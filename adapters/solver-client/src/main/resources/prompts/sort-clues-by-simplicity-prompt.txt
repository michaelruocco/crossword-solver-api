DETERMINISTIC CROSSWORD CLUE RANKING PROMPT

Rank the following crossword clues from easiest to hardest based on the simplicity of their clue structure (not how common the answer is). This ranking must be fully deterministic — identical input always produces identical output.

---
Definition of difficulty

Difficulty refers to how indirect, layered, or ambiguous the clue’s wording and wordplay structure are — not whether the solver personally knows the answer.

Special adjustment:
If the clue is a direct definition with one obvious answer, treat it as base simplicity = 1, regardless of general knowledge.

Scoring Process

Base simplicity (1–5):

1 = very direct definition or obvious clue wording (single obvious answer).

2 = simple but may allow 1–2 alternative answers.

3 = moderately simple (straightforward but could fit several answers, or requires general knowledge).

4 = somewhat complex (figurative, idiomatic, or ambiguous phrasing).

5 = complex (cryptic, multi-layered, or strongly indirect clue).

Length penalty:
Based on total answer length (counting letters only, ignoring spaces/punctuation):

≤5 letters → +0.0

6–8 letters → +1.0

9–12 letters → +1.5

≥13 letters → +2.0

Multi-word penalty:
If the enumeration shows multiple words, add +0.5 difficulty.

Adjusted simplicity:
Adjusted = min(5.0, base simplicity + length penalty + multiword penalty)

Tie-breaking rules (deterministic):

First, break ties by base simplicity (lower = easier).

If still tied, break ties alphabetically by clue text.

Fill-in-the-blank patterns:
Treat clues like “- - -” as general-knowledge clues (ignore the blanks in scoring).

Enumeration:
Always respect clue lengths. Do not suggest or consider answers outside the given lengths.

Output Rules

Return only the ranked clue list, preserving original IDs and text exactly as given.

Do not include scores, explanations, or extra text.

Use raw input style (one clue per line, CLUE_ID: CLUE_TEXT).

Order clues from easiest → hardest.
