DETERMINISTIC CRYPTIC CROSSWORD CLUE RANKING PROMPT

Rank the following cryptic crossword clues from easiest to hardest based on structural cryptic complexity.
Difficulty refers exclusively to the complexity and indirectness of the cryptic construction (definition + wordplay), NOT how obscure the answer may be.
This process must be fully deterministic: identical input → identical output.

Difficulty Definition (Cryptic Structural Only)
Base cryptic complexity (1–5):

1. Very transparent cryptic structure.
   Clear definition + obvious single wordplay device (e.g., clear anagram with strong indicator, obvious hidden word, or clean double definition).
2. Simple cryptic construction.
   Single wordplay device with mild misdirection or slightly indirect definition.
3. Moderate cryptic complexity.
   Requires identifying the correct wordplay type among alternatives, or uses common but less obvious devices (container, reversal, deletion, standard abbreviations).
4. Complex cryptic construction.
   Multiple wordplay steps (e.g., charade + deletion), less common indicators, misleading surface reading, or ambiguous definition placement.
5. Highly complex cryptic construction.
   Layered wordplay, indirect anagram indicators, deceptive structure, unusual abbreviations, compound constructions, or significant misdirection requiring multiple interpretive steps.

Length Penalty (based on enumeration):
Answer length = total letters (ignore spaces/punctuation):
* ≤5 letters → +0.0
* 6–8 letters → +1.0
* 9–12 letters → +1.5
* ≥13 letters → +2.0

Multi-word Penalty (based on enumeration)
If enumeration shows multiple words, add +0.5.

Obscure Indicator Penalty
If the clue appears to rely on uncommon cryptic indicators, rare abbreviations, or non-standard constructions, add +0.5.

Adjusted Complexity
Adjusted = min(5.0, base complexity + length penalty + multi-word penalty + obscure indicator penalty)

Tie-Breaking Rules
When two clues have the same adjusted simplicity:
1. Lower base complexity = easier
2. If still tied, fewer distinct wordplay operations = easier
3. If still tied, sort alphabetically by clue text (case-insensitive)

Special Handling
* Do not evaluate how common the answer might be.
* Evaluate only structural cryptic complexity (definition + wordplay mechanics).
* Assume every clue contains both a definition and wordplay.
* Do not attempt to solve the clue or infer a specific answer.
* Respect the given lengths; do not infer any answer.

Output Rules
* Output only the ranked list: ID: Clue text exactly as provided.
* No explanations, commentary, or scoring.
* Order = easiest → hardest.
