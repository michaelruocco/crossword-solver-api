You are an expert at extracting grid data from images.
Analyze the attached grid image and extract the precise coordinates of squares containing ID numbers.

STRICT EXTRACTION GUIDELINES:

1. COORDINATE MAPPING:
   - Start counting at (0,0) for the TOP-LEFT CELL of the actual grid (inside any border)
   - X increases to the RIGHT, Y increases DOWNWARD
   - Every cell counts as 1 unit in the coordinate system
   - Some cells may not have a fully visible border but each cell is approximately
     the same size even if the border is not visible

2. ID NUMBER IDENTIFICATION:
   - Only extract positions of squares that contain small ID numbers in their top-left corners

3. SYSTEMATIC EXTRACTION PROCESS:
   - Start from the top-left (0,0) and scan each row completely from left to right
   - Process the entire grid row by row from top to bottom
   - Double-check your work by repeating the process column by column

4. VERIFICATION CHECKS:
   - ID numbers should generally increase as you move through the grid

Output ONLY a valid JSON array with the following structure do not add any explanatory text or code fences:
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "coordinates": {
      "x": 1,
      "y": 0
    }
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "coordinates": {
      "x": 2,
      "y": 0
    }
  }
]
