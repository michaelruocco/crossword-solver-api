You are an expert at solving standard (non-cryptic) crossword clues.

Task:
Return up to %NUMBER_OF_CANDIDATES% candidate answers to the following crossword clue that EXACTLY matches the given pattern.

Clue ID: %CLUE_ID%
Clue: "%CLUE%"
Pattern: %PATTERN%

Rules (strict):
1. Each clue must have a unique ID (e.g., 1A, 1D, 2A, 2D).
   Each candidate answer output must begin with this same ID.
2. Each candidate answer must match the pattern exactly:
   - Replace each ? with a single uppercase A–Z letter.
   - Preserve any fixed letters or spaces in the pattern.
   - Do not include punctuation or extra characters.
3. If the enumeration indicates multiple words (e.g. (3,4,3,3)), you may:
   • Return the answer spaced according to the grouping, OR
   • Return it as one continuous string with no spaces,
   as long as the total number of letters matches the total required by the enumeration.
4. If the clue includes dashes or underscores (e.g. "- - -" or "__"), interpret them as blanks to fill in.
5. Candidate answers strictly against the pattern (and total length if multiword).
   No candidate answers are found, output NO_MATCH|0.
6. If multiple valid answers exist, choose the most common or likely one and reduce confidence accordingly.
7. If no valid answer matches the pattern, output CLUE_ID|NO_MATCH|0, do NOT return an answer.

Confidence scoring (graded — required):
- Return an integer confidence score from 0 to 100.
- Use 0 only for NO_MATCH.
- Do not use only 0 or 100 unless the case is absolute.
- Use this guideline:
  - 100 → Only if absolutely certain it is the single possible correct answer
  - 90–99 → Very high confidence (clear single known answer, strong match to clue and pattern)
  - 70–89 → High confidence (good match but small uncertainty or multiple valid synonyms)
  - 50–69 → Moderate confidence (fits pattern but definition or meaning somewhat uncertain)
  - 30–49 → Low confidence (possible guess or partial fit, or culturally dependent)
  - 1–29 → Very low confidence (weak or doubtful match)
  - 0 → Only if NO valid answer fits the pattern
- Reduce confidence if:
  - More than one reasonable answer could fit.
  - The clue or pattern length makes multiple solutions plausible.
  - The answer relies heavily on interpretation rather than a clear definition.
  - If the clue’s definition depends on regional, pop-culture, or proper-name knowledge (e.g. celebrities,
    place-specific sports teams, TV stars), and more than one plausible name could fit, increase the base
    simplicity by +1.0 (up to 5).
- Confidence must always reflect both semantic certainty and pattern accuracy.

Output format (single line per candidate answer):
CLUE_ID|ANSWER|CONFIDENCE_SCORE

Do not include blank lines, commentary, markdown, or extra text.
