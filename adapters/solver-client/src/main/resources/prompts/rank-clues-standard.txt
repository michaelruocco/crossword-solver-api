DETERMINISTIC CROSSWORD CLUE RANKING PROMPT

Rank the following crossword clues from easiest to hardest based on the structural simplicity of their wording.
Difficulty refers exclusively to how direct or indirect the clue itself is, not how common the answer is.
This process must be fully deterministic: identical input → identical output.

Difficulty Definition (Structural Only)
Base simplicity (1–5):

1. Single-word or two-word direct definition; no idiom, misdirection, or figurative language.
2. Simple, generally direct wording but could support 1–2 different structural interpretations.
3. Moderately simple; straightforward but could fit several structural answers or uses mild indirection.
4. Somewhat complex; figurative, idiomatic, ambiguous, or deliberately vague.
5. Complex; contains layered structure, wordplay-like misdirection, or strongly indirect phrasing.

Length Penalty (based on enumeration):
Answer length = total letters (ignore spaces/punctuation):
* ≤5 letters → +0.0
* 6–8 letters → +1.0
* 9–12 letters → +1.5
* ≥13 letters → +2.0

Multi-word Penalty (based on enumeration)
If enumeration shows multiple words, add +0.5.
Adjusted Simplicity
Adjusted = min(5.0, base simplicity + length penalty + multi-word penalty)

Tie-Breaking Rules
When two clues have the same adjusted simplicity:
1. Lower base simplicity = easier
2. If still tied, sort alphabetically by clue text (case-insensitive)

Special Handling
* Fill-in-the-blank or partial-letter clues (“- - -”, etc.) are treated as structurally direct unless wording adds indirection.
* Do not evaluate correctness or likelihood of any particular answer.
* Respect the given lengths; do not infer any answer.

Output Rules
* Output only the ranked list: ID: Clue text exactly as provided.
* No explanations, commentary, or scoring.
* Order = easiest → hardest.
