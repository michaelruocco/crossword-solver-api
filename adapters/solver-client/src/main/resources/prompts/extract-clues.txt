Prompt:

You are an expert at extracting structured crossword data from images.
Analyze the attached image of a crossword puzzle and output all clues in structured JSON format.

Instructions:

- Identify and extract every clue visible in the image, including both Across and Down clues.
- For each clue, capture:
    - "id" — the clue number
    - "text" — the full clue text, verbatim, including lengths
    - "direction" — either "ACROSS" or "DOWN"
    - "lengths" — an array of integers representing the enumeration (e.g., (3,4,3) → [3,4,3])
- If clue text contains 3 hyphens i.e. --- or - - - always include a single space between each hyphen
- Ensure clues are listed in numerical order, Across first then Down.
- Ignore any grid data — only extract text clues.
- Note that Across and Down clues often share the same ID numbers - ensure both are captured correctly
- If clues with same ID number appear in both directions, include both as separate entries
- In cases where Down clues appear in a second column or wrap to additional columns, carefully preserve all clues
- Double-check that no clues are accidentally overwritten when they share the same ID number

Output format:

- Do not add explanations, comments, or extra text.
- Do not wrap the response in code fences.
- Return the JSON array of clues in the following format:

[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "text": "Pacific republic (4)",
    "direction": "ACROSS",
    "lengths": [4]
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "text": "Gold bar (5)",
    "direction": "DOWN",
    "lengths": [5]
  }
]
