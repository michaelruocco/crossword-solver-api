Prompt:

You are an expert at extracting structured crossword data from images.
Analyze the attached image of a crossword puzzle and output all clues in structured JSON format.

Instructions:

- Identify and extract every clue visible in the image, including both Across and Down clues.
- For each clue, capture:
    - "id" — the clue number
    - "clue" — the full clue text (verbatim, without trailing punctuation unless part of the clue)
    - "direction" — either "ACROSS" or "DOWN"
    - "lengths" — an array of integers representing the enumeration (e.g., (3,4,3) → [3,4,3])
- Ensure clues are listed in numerical order, Across first then Down.
- Ignore any grid data — only extract text clues.

Output format:

- Do not add explanations, comments, or extra text.
- Do not wrap the response in code fences.
- Return the JSON array of clues in the following format:

[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "clue": "Pacific republic",
    "direction": "ACROSS",
    "lengths": [4]
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "clue": "Gold bar",
    "direction": "DOWN",
    "lengths": [5]
  }
]
