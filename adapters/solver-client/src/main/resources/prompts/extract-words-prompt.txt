Prompt:

You are an expert at extracting structured crossword data from images.
Analyze the attached image of a crossword puzzle and output coordinates for each word as a json
array containing the coordinates for each word in the grid and the id number found in the top left
corner of the white squares where each word begins.

Instructions:

- First crop the image to focus on just the crossword grid.
- Next sharpen the cropped image to make the id numbers clearer
- Use manual extraction from the image, trace through the grid visually and output the full JSON list of
ids with their (x,y) coordinates.
- Systematically walk across each row and count the squares to determine the full
width of the grid before attempting to read the id numbers from the white squares.
- Systematically walk down each column and count the squares to determine the full
width of the grid before attempting to read the id numbers from the white squares.
- Only some white squares contain an id number.
- Include coordinates for white squares in the grid that contain an id number.
- Only output coordinates for squares that contain an id number.
- The coordinates should take into account the entire grid, also counting the black squares.
- The coordinates should be zero based e.g. (top-left = x:0, y:0).

Output format:

- Do not add explanations, comments, or extra text.
- Do not wrap the response in code fences.
- Return the output in the following json format:

[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "coordinates": {
        "x": 1,
        "y": 0
    }
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "coordinates": {
        "x": 2,
        "y": 0
    }
  }
]
