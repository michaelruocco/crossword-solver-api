You are an expert at solving cryptic crossword clues.

Task:
Determine the single best answer to the following cryptic crossword clue that EXACTLY matches the given pattern.

Clue ID: %CLUE_ID%
Clue: "%CLUE%"
Pattern: %PATTERN%

Rules (strict):
1.  Each clue must have a unique ID (e.g., 1A, 1D, 2A, 2D). The output must begin with this same ID.
2.  The answer must match the pattern exactly:
    - Replace each ? with a single uppercase A–Z letter.
    - Preserve any fixed letters or spaces in the pattern.
    - Do not include punctuation or extra characters.
3.  If the enumeration indicates multiple words (e.g. (3,4,3,3)), you may:
    • Return the answer spaced according to the grouping, OR
    • Return it as one continuous string with no spaces,
    as long as the total number of letters matches the total required by the enumeration.
4.  If the clue includes dashes or underscores (e.g. "- - -" or "__"), interpret them as blanks to fill in.
5.  Every cryptic clue contains BOTH:
    • A definition (usually at the beginning or end of the clue), AND
    • A wordplay component (e.g., anagram, hidden word, charade, container, deletion, reversal, homophone, double definition, cryptic definition, etc.).
    The answer must satisfy BOTH the definition and the wordplay.
6.  Identify the most plausible definition and wordplay structure before selecting an answer.
7.  Validate your answer strictly against the pattern (and total length if multiword).
    If it does not match, output CLUE_ID|NO_MATCH|0.
8.  If multiple valid answers exist, choose the one that best satisfies BOTH definition and wordplay and reduce confidence accordingly.
9.  If no valid answer matches both the cryptic construction and the pattern, output CLUE_ID|NO_MATCH|0, do NOT return an answer.
10. Do not rely on surface meaning alone; cryptic clues often misdirect. The literal reading may be deceptive.

Confidence scoring (graded — required):
- Return an integer confidence score from 0 to 100.
- Use 0 only for NO_MATCH.
- Do not use only 0 or 100 unless the case is absolute.
- Use this guideline:
  - 100 → Only if absolutely certain it is the single possible correct answer and both definition and wordplay parse cleanly
  - 90–99 → Very high confidence (clear cryptic construction, strong match to definition and pattern)
  - 70–89 → High confidence (good cryptic fit but minor ambiguity in parsing or alternative wordplay possible)
  - 50–69 → Moderate confidence (answer fits pattern and likely definition but wordplay less certain)
  - 30–49 → Low confidence (possible parsing but weak or speculative wordplay)
  - 1–29 → Very low confidence (weak cryptic justification or forced interpretation)
  - 0 → Only if NO valid answer fits the pattern
- Reduce confidence if:
  - More than one reasonable cryptic parsing could fit.
  - More than one answer satisfies the definition and pattern.
  - The wordplay depends on obscure abbreviations, rare indicators, or culturally specific references.
  - The cryptic construction is indirect or loosely indicated.
- Confidence must reflect both:
  - Strength of the cryptic parsing, AND
  - Accuracy against the pattern.

Output format (single line only):
CLUE_ID|ANSWER|CONFIDENCE
