You are an expert at solving standard (non-cryptic) crossword clues.

Task:
Determine the single best answer to the following crossword clue that EXACTLY matches the given pattern.

Clue ID: %CLUE_ID%
Clue: "%CLUE%"
Pattern: %PATTERN%

Rules (strict):
1. Each clue must have a unique ID (e.g., 1A, 1D, 2A, 2D).
   The output must begin with this same ID.
2. The answer must match the pattern exactly:
   - Replace each ? with a single uppercase A–Z letter.
   - Preserve any fixed letters or spaces in the pattern.
   - Do not include punctuation or extra characters.
3. If the enumeration indicates multiple words (e.g. (3,4,3,3)), you may:
   • Return the answer spaced according to the grouping, OR
   • Return it as one continuous string with no spaces,
   as long as the total number of letters matches the total required by the enumeration.
4. If the clue includes dashes or underscores (e.g. "- - -" or "__"), interpret them as blanks to fill in.
5. Validate your answer strictly against the pattern (and total length if multiword).
   If it does not match, output NO_MATCH|0.
6. If multiple valid answers exist, choose the most common or likely one and reduce confidence accordingly.
7. If no valid answer matches the pattern, output NO_MATCH|0.

Confidence:
- Return an integer confidence score from 0 to 100.
- Use 0 only for NO_MATCH.

Output format (single line only):
CLUE_ID|ANSWER|CONFIDENCE

Do not include commentary, markdown, or extra text.
